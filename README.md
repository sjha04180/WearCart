# WearCart - Hybrid Web2 & Web3 Apparel E-commerce & Business Management System

**WearCart** is a modern full-stack hybrid apparel e-commerce and enterprise business management platform. It offers a traditional retail experience combined with decentralized Web3 payments and smart contracts. Customers can browse clothing items, apply coupons, and checkout using either traditional cards/UPI (via Razorpay) or cryptocurrency (ETH on Ethereum/Sepolia) directly via connected Web3 wallets. Administrators are equipped with comprehensive tools for managing inventory, orders, invoices, payments, and vendor purchases.

## ⚡ Key Highlights & Advancements

*   **Hybrid Payment Gateway**: Supports both traditional electronic payments (Credit/Debit Cards, UPI, NetBanking via **Razorpay**) and decentralized blockchain payments (**ETH** via a Solidity smart contract).
*   **Web3 Wallet Integration**: Out-of-the-box wallet connectivity supporting MetaMask, Rainbow, and other wallets using **RainbowKit** and **Wagmi** on the frontend.
*   **Decentralized Smart Contracts**: A custom-built Solidity smart contract (`ApparelMarketplace.sol`) deployed on the Ethereum Sepolia network handles on-chain product listings, decentralized stock queries, item purchases, and secure contract fund withdrawals.
*   **Enterprise Administration**: Fully integrated back-office system for tracking sale orders, vendor purchase orders, generating customer invoices, logging vendor bills, tracking incoming payments, and generating sales/purchase reports.
*   **Automatic Stock Control**: Inventory quantities automatically sync in real-time, reducing stock upon sale order confirmations (both Web2 and Web3) and increasing stock when vendor purchase orders are confirmed.
*   **Automated Invoicing Engine**: Configurable system setting to automatically generate and issue customer invoices immediately after checkout payments are verified.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

Follow these steps sequentially to set up and run the hybrid system locally.

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
*   [Node.js (v18+)](https://nodejs.org/)
*   [PostgreSQL (v12+)](https://www.postgresql.org/) OR a [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) Account
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
*   [WalletConnect Project ID](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/) (Required for RainbowKit connection on the frontend)

---

### 2. Backend Setup

1.  Navigate into the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Create a `.env` file in the root of the `backend` directory:
    ```env
    PORT=5000
    NODE_ENV=development
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

    # PostgreSQL Database Credentials
    DB_HOST=localhost                # Or your Supabase Host
    DB_PORT=5432                     # Or your Supabase transaction port (e.g. 6543)
    DB_USER=postgres                 # Or your Supabase User
    DB_PASSWORD=your_password        # Or your Supabase Database Password
    DB_NAME=wearcart                 # Or your Supabase Database Name
    DB_SSL=false                     # Set to true if using Supabase or host requiring SSL
    ```
4.  Create the database in PostgreSQL:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE wearcart;
    ```
5.  Seed the database (Creates tables and populates sample data):
    ```bash
    npm run seed
    ```
6.  Start the Express backend server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The server will boot up at `http://localhost:5000`.

---

### 3. Frontend Setup

1.  Navigate into the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the `frontend` directory:
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_walletconnect_project_id
    ```
4.  Start the Next.js development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will run locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

### 4. Smart Contract Integration

The smart contract is written in Solidity and compiled for deployment.
*   **Contract Code**: [ApparelMarketplace.sol](./web3/contracts/ApparelMarketplace.sol)
*   **Deployment**: The contract should be compiled and deployed on an EVM-compatible chain (e.g., Sepolia Testnet). Once deployed, replace the `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` variable in [web3.ts](./frontend/utils/web3.ts):
    ```typescript
    export const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';
    ```

---

## 🗄️ Database Models

*   **Users**: Stores user profiles for portal shoppers and internal admin users (distinguished by roles).
*   **Contacts**: Represents customers and vendors including addresses and configuration.
*   **Products**: Contains catalog item descriptions, categories, pricing, tax information, and current inventory stock level.
*   **Payment Terms**: Defines conditions of payments (e.g., immediate payment, or 15/30-day terms with early-payment discounts).
*   **Discount Offers**: Defines global discount promotions, percentage cuts, and applicable date ranges.
*   **Coupon Codes**: Unique voucher strings linked to discount offers, featuring validation controls (restricted by contact or usage limits).
*   **Sale Orders**: Client purchase receipts, recording totals, items, payment method (`crypto`/`razorpay`), and transaction verification hash (`txHash`).
*   **Purchase Orders**: Procurement documents issued to suppliers for inventory restock.
*   **Customer Invoices**: Sales invoices generated from sale orders for finance tracking.
*   **Vendor Bills**: Logged supplier invoices derived from purchase orders.
*   **Payments**: System transaction log capturing payment date, amount, payment method (cash, card, bank transfer, online, crypto), and verification reference ID.
